# RayTracingInAWeekend
This is a simple RayTracing engine made following the amazing book "Ray Tracing in one weekend" by  Peter Shirley, Trevor David Black and Steve Hollasch.
The project is written in C++, which I am still learning and this project was really interesting to get my feet more than wet with the language.

Some of the images created in the various steps of the lessons are the following:

Introduction of adjustable camera position to modify the FOV and distance from the rendered objects.

![bigboss](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61c7fb96-340a-414e-b6f2-3b352c620f1e)
Tough image with lots of objects/points/rays to compute, heavy on CPU that took some time to render.
